      The dim_date table is a dimension table that stores detailed information about dates, providing a standardized, 
      structured reference for temporal data. It is a key component of a star schema in data warehouses and is used to enable efficient 
      time-based analysis, reporting, and aggregations. 
      The dim_date table allows users to slice and dice data by various time attributes such as year, 
      quarter, month, day, weekday, and fiscal periods, among others. This table plays a critical role in time-series analysis,
      trend tracking, and seasonal reporting.
