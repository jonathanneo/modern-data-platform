      The dim_order_status table is a dimension table that stores information about the various statuses that an order can have throughout its lifecycle. 
      The table can be used to categorize and track the progression of orders in systems such as e-commerce, retail, or order management systems. 
      This table enables users to analyze order statuses, track fulfillment progress, and segment orders by their current state, 
      helping businesses manage order fulfillment, shipping, customer service, and overall operational performance.
